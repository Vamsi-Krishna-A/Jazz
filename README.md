# About

This is my first repository and contains generalized solutions for real-time problems that me or some of my friends faced. Most of this would be about automating mundane, redundant and time taking tasks of system administration and/or cloud administration. Please find the index below for files in this repository and their explanation. I'll try to be as eloborated of the problems and solutions as possible.
